I was responsible for the whole physics analysis, the \( c \rightarrow e \) \( v_2 \) calculation assuming charm hadrons follow NCQ scaling, and most of the paper writing.</li>
      <li> Take the leading role in measuring \(D^{*+}\) production and \(D^{*+}/D^{0}\) yields ratio in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV at the STAR utilizing Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT). Responsible for the whole data analysis. </li>
      <li>Contribute to the measurements of \( \Lambda_{c}^+ \) production in Au + Au collisions at \( \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 \) GeV in the STAR. To better understand the data and hadronization mechanism in heavy ion collisions and smaller collision systems, I study a series of charmed hadrons to \( D^{0} \) ratios in p+p collisions as a function of momentum and multiplicity with PYTHIA8 under different color reconnection frameworks.</li>

      <li>Contribute to the physics simulation in the future EIC detector using open heavy flavor hadrons as probes. I worked on the physics projection of the production of charm baryons in ep and eA collisions which is to investigate the charm hadronization and, more generally, the baryon formation mechanism. I also worked on the physics projection of near-threshold \( \Upsilon \) production cross section in ep(\( \gamma p \)) collisions in the future EIC detector. Near-threshold heavy-flavor quarkonium production was proposed to be connected with the gravitational form factor of nucleons which are defined as the lowest moments of the spin-independent gluon GPDs. I led the physics simulation for ATHENA detector proposal Fig. 26, 40(left), and 49.</li>

The goal is to have a usable PYTHIA8 tuning with an improved description of the underlying events in jet measurements at RHIC and predict the forward physics at STAR. The tuning utilized the Professor toolkit and a series of RIVET analyses on available STAR jets and identified particle spectra measurements. I wrote the RIVET analysis for identified particle spectra measurements at STAR, an important component of this project.
